# NEU-Quadruped-robot-dynamic-RGBD-dataset

This dataset was recorded by mounting a RGBD camera on Unitree B1, and the ground truth was captured by motion capture equipment.
The dataset includes both dynamic and static scenes.
The dataset will be constantly updated, in hope of contributing to the research on dynamic SLAM.
